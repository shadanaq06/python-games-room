# üé≤ Games Room - using Python

This repository contains three simple Python mini-games:

1. **Number Guess Game**
2. **Modified Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock (RPSLS)**
3. **Coin Flip Game**

## üéÆ Description

 **Number Guess Game**
  You guess a number between 2 and 12 (the possible sum of two dice rolls). The program rolls two dice and sums them up. You earn points based on how close your guess is to the dice sum:

  * Exact match: 10 points
  * Within 1 of the sum: 5 points
  * Within 3 of the sum: 1 point
  * Otherwise: 0 points

 **Modified RPSLS Game**
  A variation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game with two additional moves: Lizard and Spock. The interactions between Spock and Lizard are swapped from the traditional rules.
  You pick a move, the computer randomly picks one, and points are awarded as follows:

  * Win: 10 points
  * Tie: 5 points
  * Lose: 0 points

 **Coin Flip Game**
  Simulates repeated coin flips. Scoring depends on the first flip:

  * If the first flip is tails, you earn 2 points for each heads flip until the next tails, then the game ends.
  * If the first flip is heads, you earn 1 point for each tails flip until you flip heads two more times, then the game ends.
